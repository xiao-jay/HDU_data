Transportation has been greatly changed since the past few years.  Ancient days, people used to travel by horse or carriage. The journey was often tiring and tedious. Then people had buses, trains and ships, which could shorten the time of the trip. Now we have not only more private cars, but also planes and rails. All of these modern transports could offer us a quick and pleasant travel. Thus, more and more people enjoy traveling very much these days.  Conclusion, modern transportation has completely changed our life. Thanks to modern transportation, our world is becoming smaller and smaller. aaa.
